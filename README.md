# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Internship: AI & ML Internship  
**Task Name:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Dataset Used:** Iris Dataset  

---

## 🖥️ Software Used
- Google Colab (Recommended)
- Python

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The **Iris dataset** contains 150 records of iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target Variable)

The dataset is clean and widely used for classification problems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of EDA
- Understand data distribution
- Analyze target variable balance
- Detect outliers
- Study correlation between features
- Identify important features for prediction

---

## 📊 EDA Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Dataset Loading & Inspection
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked structure and data types

### 2️⃣ Distribution Analysis
- Plotted histograms for numerical features
- Observed normal distribution patterns

### 3️⃣ Categorical Analysis
- Used count plot to analyze species distribution
- Dataset found to be balanced

### 4️⃣ Outlier Detection
- Used box plots
- Minor outliers observed in sepal width

### 5️⃣ Correlation Analysis
- Plotted correlation heatmap
- Strong correlation found between petal length and petal width

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Petal features are most important for classification
- Dataset is balanced across all species
- Multicollinearity exists between petal features
- Dataset is ideal for machine learning models
